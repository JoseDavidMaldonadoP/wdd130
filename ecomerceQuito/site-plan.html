      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The fundamental idea of the project is to create an e-commerce store 
        for the city of Quito, where we will connect multiple professional 
        services and entrepreneurial businesses with their future clients
         through the website which will allow the supplier to register their
         product, brand and / or service with a subscription that will allow 
         you to access advertising and product delivery facilities to your 
         customers.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Our audience is every entrepreneur, or independent professional service,
        or medium-sized business,  that is developing an idea or business 
        but does not have the facility to advertise their product on the 
        web and/or cannot manage their business digitally.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h2>Branding</h2>
      <h3>Website Logo</h3>
